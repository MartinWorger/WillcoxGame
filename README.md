# Willcox Game

## Children's Party Game

As a popular and intelligent 5-year-old, you are invited to many parties. At every one of these parties,
the birthday girl/boy gives away a gift to one of the attending children. To determine who receives this
gift you all sit in a large circle and the host sings a rhyme moving along one child for each word. When
the rhyme ends that child is removed from the game. They then move on to the next child in the circle
and start the rhyme again, in so removing children from the circle until one remains. This child receives
the gift.
At the last party, there were 6 children, including the host. The host chose to sing the rhyme “Ip dip sky
blue It is not you”. Starting at child 1 they counted round, first eliminating child 3. The second time
around they started at child 4 as 3 had just been removed. Counting around, child 2 gets removed.
The third time child 5 is removed. In the final round, child 4 gets removed and child 1 wins the
prize.

## Your Task

You decide to write a simple program that given the number of children and length of a rhyme will
calculate the winning position to sit.
